**AWS APIG integration outside of was**

With Amazon API Gateway, you can integrate with HTTP endpoints hosted outside of AWS, including on-premises servers or other cloud providers, as long as they ~={green}are accessible via the public internet=~. API Gateway supports integrating with any publicly accessible HTTP/HTTPS endpoint.

To integrate API Gateway with external HTTP endpoints, you can use the ~={green}"HTTP Proxy"=~ integration type. This allows API Gateway to pass the incoming request from the client directly to your HTTP endpoint without any additional configuration. You simply need to provide the publicly accessible URL of your external service when setting up the integration.

For more details on configuring HTTP Proxy integrations, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-develop-integrations-http.html) .

BIG QUESTION => connection to services is through internet ? Or we will create some more secure way to do it ? What way ?

Yes, you can use AWS API Gateway to securely access services hosted outside of AWS, even if they are behind a firewall or within a private network, by leveraging ~={green}AWS IoT Secure Tunneling.=~

AWS IoT Secure Tunneling allows you to establish a bidirectional communication tunnel between API Gateway and your remote services or devices that are behind a firewall or within a private network. This secure tunnel is managed by AWS IoT Core and provides an encrypted connection over the public internet.

To set this up, you would first create a secure tunnel using AWS IoT Secure Tunneling. Then, you can configure API Gateway to use this tunnel as the integration endpoint for your API. This way, API Gateway can securely communicate with your remote services through the secure tunnel, without exposing them directly to the public internet.

You can find more details on setting up and using AWS IoT Secure Tunneling with API Gateway in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-private-apis.html)

=> if I have some existing api gateway on other services, and now i want to move to aws api gateway, how can i do it ? do I have to creating new endpoint ?

If you have existing APIs hosted on other services and want to migrate them to AWS API Gateway, you have a few options:

1. **Import API definitions**: AWS API Gateway allows you to import existing API definitions in popular formats like Swagger/OpenAPI, WSDL, etc. You can import your existing API definitions into API Gateway in minutes using the provided import tools, and then connect them to new or existing AWS service implementations.
2. **Create new APIs**: If your existing APIs don't have a standard definition format, you can create new APIs from scratch within API Gateway. You can define the resources, methods, and integrations based on your existing API specifications.
3. **Use API Gateway as a proxy**: You can also use API Gateway as a proxy to your existing APIs hosted elsewhere. With this approach, you configure API Gateway to forward incoming requests to your existing API endpoints, essentially acting as a proxy layer in front of your APIs.

Regardless of the approach, you will need to create new API endpoints within API Gateway. However, API Gateway provides tools to help streamline the migration process, such as importing existing definitions, cloning APIs, and deploying multiple stages for testing and rollout.

It's recommended to review the [API Gateway documentation .](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)

for detailed guidance on migrating APIs to AWS, as well as best practices for API design and deployment.

=>I want to switch gateways in low time, as fast as possible

To switch between Direct Connect gateways with minimal downtime, you can follow the approach outlined in the AWS blog post "How to Seamlessly Migrate Traffic Between Direct Connect Gateways":

1. Provision temporary hybrid network infrastructure (Direct Connect gateway and transit gateway) to support the migration. This can be owned by either the source or destination AWS account.
2. Associate the temporary Direct Connect gateway with the existing virtual private gateway (VGW) to establish connectivity.
3. Create a transit gateway route table and associate it with the VPC route tables to route traffic through the temporary infrastructure.
4. Once traffic is flowing through the temporary infrastructure, associate the new Direct Connect gateway (owned by the destination account) with the transit gateway.
5. Update the transit gateway route table to route traffic through the new Direct Connect gateway.
6. Remove the temporary Direct Connect gateway association and clean up temporary resources.

This approach avoids the connectivity loss that would occur if you simply disassociated the VGW from the old Direct Connect gateway before associating it with the new one. By using a temporary transit gateway setup, you can switch gateways with minimal downtime.

Refer to the [blog post .](https://aws.amazon.com/en/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/how-to-seamlessly-migrate-traffic-between-direct-connect-gateways)

for detailed step-by-step instructions on implementing this migration process.

=>  want to swtich api gateway from other services to aws api gateway in as low lattency as possible as fast as possible

To switch your existing API gateway from other services to AWS API Gateway with minimal latency and downtime, you can follow these steps:

1. **Import API definition**: Import your existing API definition (e.g. Swagger/OpenAPI) into AWS API Gateway. This will create a new API in AWS while preserving your existing API structure.
2. **Configure integrations**: Set up the integrations in AWS API Gateway to point to your existing backend services or AWS services you want to use.
3. **Use Edge-Optimized API endpoint**: Deploy your API to an Edge-Optimized API endpoint in AWS API Gateway. This uses Amazon CloudFront's global CDN to reduce latency by routing requests through the nearest edge location.
4. **Test and validate**: Test your new API in AWS by sending requests to the Edge-Optimized endpoint and validating the responses match your existing API.
5. **Switch traffic**: Once validated, update your client applications to send requests to the new Edge-Optimized API endpoint in AWS API Gateway instead of your previous API gateway.
6. **Monitor and optimize**: Monitor the performance of your API using Amazon CloudWatch metrics. Optimize caching settings, enable AWS Global Accelerator, or consider a Regional API endpoint if needed for lower latency.

By importing your existing API definition and using Edge-Optimized endpoints, you can minimize downtime and latency when switching to AWS API Gateway. Refer to the [API Gateway documentation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)

for more details on optimizing performance.

==>so I will have to update endpoint to new one?

Yes, when migrating your existing API gateway to AWS API Gateway, you will need to update the endpoint URL in your client applications to point to the new API endpoint created in AWS API Gateway.

After importing your API definition and setting up the integrations in AWS API Gateway, you will get a new endpoint URL (either Edge-Optimized or Regional). You will need to update this new endpoint URL in all the client applications or services that consume your API.

It's recommended to first test the new API endpoint thoroughly before updating the clients to ensure a smooth transition. Once you have validated that the new AWS API Gateway endpoint is working as expected, you can update the client applications to use the new endpoint URL.

Updating the endpoint URL is a necessary step to switch from your existing API gateway to the new one hosted on AWS API Gateway. This allows your client applications to start sending requests to the AWS API Gateway endpoint instead of the old gateway.
