Get an access token with a custom scope. M2M tokens must contain at least one scope to define what they provide access to. We automatically created the default-m2m-resource-server/read resource server and custom scope. To modify the default resource server or add a new one, go to Resource servers in the Domain menu of this user pool.

```
import requests
response = requests.post(
    'https://<user pool domain>/oauth2/token',
    data="grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=59nfc9iolk2abgom5g0lrccnt9&client_secret=<client secret>&scope=default-m2m-resource-server-sdai3g/read",
    headers={'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}
)
print(response.json())
```

### policy for lambda/cognito

```
To allow an AWS Lambda authorizer to access Amazon Cognito, you need to attach an IAM policy to the Lambda function's execution role. Below is the required policy and instructions on where to apply it:

IAM Policy for Cognito Access
Here is an example policy that grants the Lambda function permissions to interact with Amazon Cognito:

json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cognito-idp:DescribeUserPool",
        "cognito-idp:ListUsers",
        "cognito-idp:GetUser"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:cognito-idp:<region>:<account-id>:userpool/<user-pool-id>"
    }
  ]
}
Replace <region>, <account-id>, and <user-pool-id> with your specific AWS region, account ID, and Cognito user pool ID.

Where to Apply the Policy
Attach to Lambda Execution Role:

Navigate to the IAM Console in AWS.

Find or create the IAM role associated with your Lambda function.

Add the above policy as an inline policy or attach it as a managed policy.

Verify Lambda Role in AWS Console:

Go to Lambda Console.

Select your Lambda function.

Under the Configuration tab, check the execution role linked to the function. Ensure it has the necessary permissions.

API Gateway Configuration:

In API Gateway, link your Lambda authorizer to the specific API method by navigating to Resources > Method > Authorization, and select your custom authorizer.

Additional Notes
If you're using a Lambda authorizer with API Gateway, ensure that the authorizer is configured correctly in API Gateway under Authorizers. You can specify token validation and caching settings for better performance.

The Lambda authorizer will use this policy to retrieve user details from Cognito and validate tokens during API requests.
