#regex


Here's a detailed explanation of the regex pattern 
^(?!.*\..*\.)/company/[^/.]+/[^/.]+/documents/.+$:

üîç Regex Breakdown
1. Negative Lookahead: (?!.*\..*\.)
Purpose: Blocks paths containing two or more dots (e.g., file..txt or ../hack).

Mechanics:

.* = Any characters (except newlines)

\..*\. = Matches two dots with optional characters between them

Fails if two dots appear anywhere in the path.

2. Path Structure: /company/[^/.]+/[^/.]+/documents/.+
Segment 1: [^/.]+

Matches 1+ characters except / or . (e.g., 123, abc).

Ensures no dots in company/ID segments.

Segment 2: [^/.]+

Same restriction as Segment 1.

Documents Path: /.+

.+ = Requires 1+ characters after /documents/.

Allows subpaths (e.g., /reports/2024.pdf).

3. Anchors: ^ and $
^ = Start of string

$ = End of string

Ensures the entire path matches the pattern.

‚úÖ Valid Matches
/company/123/abc/documents/annual_report.pdf

/company/456/def/documents/2024/Q1

/company/xyz/789/documents/file.txt

‚ùå Blocked Paths
/company/123/../hack/documents/secret (Two dots)

/company/.../hack/documents/exploit (Three dots)

/company/123/abc/documents/ (Empty segment)

/company/123/abc.doc/documents/file (Dot in segment)

üîß Key Security Features
Dot Control:

Allows single dots (e.g., file.txt) but blocks file.tar.gz or path traversal (../../).

Segment Sanitization:

Prevents dots in company/ID segments (/company/123.4/... ‚Üí invalid).

Non-Empty Documents Path:

Ensures /documents/ has content (no trailing slash alone).

This regex balances flexibility for valid URLs while blocking common attack patterns.
